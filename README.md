**Krakenator**:  
Info: Sets component versions to current prod versions for whatever json file you pass it (dev, demo, etc).  
Useful when you want to deploy the current prod version of an environment without having to go manually look up hashes, tag names, branches, w/e else. Only works with Kraken release templates (dev.json, demo.json).
